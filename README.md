# BeeHivesTrees
Add a chance to add a beehive when a tree grows from a sapling

**This repository is a fork of Esmorall's one**, you can find its plugin page on Spigot.

* [Emerall's repository](https://github.com/Esmorall/BeeHivesTrees)
* [BeeHivesTrees plugin on Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/beehivestrees-grow-trees-from-saplings-with-bees.73394/)

For now I have no ambition to make it differs more than what I did in my [1.1-custom version](https://github.com/arboriginal/BeeHivesTrees/releases/tag/1.1-custom):
* Replace number of bees by a range instead of fixed number
* Add option not to consider trees grown with bone meal
* Converted to Maven (and minor optimisations / simplifications)

As told [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/beehivestrees-grow-trees-from-saplings-with-bees.407826/#post-3636858), Emerall is allowed to re-use my modifications, partially or not, to update his plugin.

This repository will stay a sidekick, not a competitor for it. So you should use the official version. This one will not receive support, or very limited. If eventually I add new things, the previous paragraph stays valid. So, if I forget to tell it to Emerall and you need them, ask him to inject them in his next release (and use mine temporary).
